        <section name="gui4j - Swing GUIs in XML">
            <p>
        gui4j is a framework for describing Java Swing GUIs completely in XML.</p>
        <p>The graphical user interface 
        is created dynamically based on the XML definitions. Each GUI window is associated with exactly one top-level 
        XML file. Each XML file can dynamically include other XML files to support complex GUI definitions. Each XML 
        file is associated with a java object that acts as both a Controller and a Model for the 
        GUI. There is a strong layer separation between the GUI and the Controller: GUI definitions in the XML files 
        can access all Java methods of the Controller, but Java methods cannot access any GUI elements directly. Events 
        are used to trigger changes in the GUI.</p>
        <p> Gui4j requires Java 1.4.0 or higher. </p>
