description = A component for laying out forms with label/component pairs. \
	\n \n \
	The subelements {@link labels} and {@link components} allow the \
	definition of arbitrary gui4j components. The first "component" is laid out directly to the right of the first "label", the \
	second "component" is laid out to the right of the second "label" and so on. As a "label" you will usually use a normal gui4j \
	label. As a "component" you will probably often use edit fields or comboboxes. The markers are optional and are laid out \
	to the left of their associated labels. These could be used, for example, to display icons in front of some of the labels \
	without losing the left alignment of the labels' texts (which you would lose if you'd put the icons on the label components \
	directly).{@br} \
	You can either specify labels and components directly as children of labelForm, or you can use labelColumns as children \
	of the labelForm and specify labels and components inside each labelColumn.

attribute_columns = Specifies if the labels/components should automatically be laid out in several columns. \
The attribute value defines how many columns should be used to lay out the given label/component pairs. One "column" in this sense \
always consists of a number of labels and their associated components. Default value is 1. For example, if you define \
4 labels and 4 components and do not define a columns attribute, the 4 labels are placed one below each other, each with \
its component to its right. If you define columns=2, the first two label/column pairs are placed below eachh other \
and the next 2 label/component pairs are placed to the right of the first two label/column pairs. {@br} \
This attribute is ignored if you specify more than one column directly using {@link labelColumn}s.

attribute_colSpacing = Defines the horizontal space in pixels between the several label/component columns that you specified either by \
using the {@tt columns} attribute or by using several {@link labelColumn}s).

attribute_componentWidths = Defines the widths of the components per label/component column. Expected is a string containing a \
comma separated list of either "p", meaning "preferred size", "f" meaning "fill excess space" or an integer denoting a width in pixels. \
If a {@tt labelColumn} defines its own {@tt componentWidth} it will take precedence over this attribute.

attribute_hSpacing = Defines the space in pixels between the label and the component to its right.

attribute_vSpacing = Defines the space between two rows of label/component pairs.

markers_description = Inside this tag you can define arbitrary gui4j components. These components act as "markers" in the layout \
of the labelForm.

labels_description = Inside this tag you can define arbitrary gui4j components. These components act as "labels" in the layout \
of the labelForm. If a "label" component is actually a gui4j {@link label}, then it is associated with its corresponding "component" component \
so that activating the mnemonic on the label will cause the component to get the focus.

components_description = Inside this tag you can define arbitrary gui4j components. These components act as "components" in the layout \
of the labelForm.

labelColumn_description = {@tt labelColumn}s are used inside {@link labelForm}s to manually specify several columns \
of labels and components. Each {@tt labelColumn} defines one such column. The columns are laid out from left to right. \
If you only want to define one column you can alternatively use {@link labels} and {@link components} directly inside a {@link labelForm}.

labelColumn_attribute_componentWidth = Specifies the width of the components in this column. You can specify either "p", \
meaning "preferred size", "f" meaning "fill excess space" or an integer denoting a width in pixels. \
This attribute takes precedence over {@tt componentWidths} in {@link labelForm}.

labelColumn_attribute_colSpans = Optional. Specifies the column span of the components in this column. Expected is a comma separated list \
of integers denoting the column spans of the components in this column in the order of their appearance under {@link components}. \
If a component has a column span of 1, which is the default, it will occupy only its own cell. If it has column span greater than 1, \
it will be stretched horizontally to also occupy columns to the right. Specify "all" instead of an integer to cause a component to \
span to the rightmost column of the {@link labelForm}. The columns that are affected by the column span will lay out their own \
components around the occupied cells, i.e. a column span will not cause a stretched component to hide a component of the \
neighboring column.
