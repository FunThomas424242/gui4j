description = Represents a label. A label is a simple component that can display text and an icon.

attribute_hAlignment = Defines the horizontal alignment of the text inside the component.
attribute_hAlignment_param_right = Text is right-aligned.
attribute_hAlignment_param_center = Text is center-aligned.
attribute_hAlignment_param_leading = Text is aligned to the leading edge of the component's orientation, \
	for example, to the left in left-to-right orientations.
attribute_hAlignment_param_trailing = Text is aligned to the trailing edge of the component's orientation, \
	for example, to the right in left-to-right orientations.
attribute_hAlignment_param_left = Text is left-aligned.

attribute_icon = The icon to display along with the text.

attribute_hTextPosition = Defines the horizontal position of the label's text relative to its icon. \
	Will be ignored if no icon is specified. 
attribute_hTextPosition_param_right = Text is right-aligned, icon left.
attribute_hTextPosition_param_center = Text is center-aligned.
attribute_hTextPosition_param_leading = Text is aligned leading to the icon's position, i.e. text first, icon afterwards.
attribute_hTextPosition_param_trailing = Text is aligned trailing to the icons position, i.e. icon first, text afterwards.
attribute_hTextPosition_param_left = Text is left-aligned, icon right.

attribute_labelFor = References another component this label is associated with. If this label specifies \
	a mnemonic, the respective key stroke will focus the associated component.
attribute_mnemonic = A mnemonic for this label, i.e. a character which can be used as a shortcut \
	to focus the component assoicated with this label via {@tt labelFor}.

attribute_suffix = The suffix is automatically appended to the end of the label's text. This attribute \
	is best used together with gui4j's style features. That way, you could append \
	an ":" to all labels on a form without having to change each individual label's text.

attribute_text = The text of this label.

attribute_vAlignment = Vertical alignment of the text inside this component.
attribute_vAlignment_param_bottom = Text is bottom-aligned.
attribute_vAlignment_param_center = Text is centered.
attribute_vAlignment_param_top = Text is top-aligned.

attribute_vTextPosition = Defines the vertical position of the label's text, relative to its icon. \
	Will be ignored, if no icon is specified.
attribute_vTextPosition_param_bottom = Text is aligned at the icon's bottom.
attribute_vTextPosition_param_center = Text is centered.
attribute_vTextPosition_param_top = Text is aligned at the icon's top.
