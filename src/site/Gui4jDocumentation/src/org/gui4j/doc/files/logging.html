		<h1>Logging</h1>
		<p>gui4j uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">Jakarta Commons Logging</a> as its logging API.
In your project you should therefore initialize a compatible logging framework. Experiment with different
log levels to see what is being logged. In normal operations, you will usually use WARN or INFO.</p>
		<p>When creating your <tt>Gui4j</tt> instance via the <tt>Gui4jFactory</tt>, you must supply a parameter
that defines if method invocations from the frameworks into your controllers should be logged. You can set
this parameter to <tt>true</tt> in order to debug problems related to method calls. Due to the number
of log messages produced, you should set this parameter to <tt>false</tt> in production environments.
		</p>
		<p>If you get a stacktrace caused by a gui4j worker thread, you will possibly want to know
which gui4j method call caused the worker thread to run. To get this additional information in case
of an internal gui4j error, you can call <tt>Gui4j.setTraceWorkerInvocation(true)</tt>. This can
be a great help in debugging. Don't turn this feature on in production, since the internal overhead of
creating a stacktrace for each worker invocation might be high.
