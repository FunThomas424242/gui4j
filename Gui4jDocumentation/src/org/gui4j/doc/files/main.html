		gui4j is a framework for describing graphical user interfaces completely in XML. The graphical user
		interface is created dynamically based on the xml definition.<br>
		Each GUI window is
		associated to exactly one top-level xml-file which can be defined using other xml-files. The 
		top-level xml-file is read by one controller and each included xml-file might use another controller to
		structure complex GUI definitions.<br>
		There is a strong separation between the GUI and the Java code which implies that GUI definitions
		in the xml files can access Java methods, but Java methods cannot access GUI elements.
