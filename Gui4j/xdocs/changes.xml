                a normal java.awt.Frame or java.awt.Dialog as a parent.
            </action>
            <action dev="kayk" type="add">
                Added attribute "hAlignment" to component "hbox" and attribute "vAlignment"

        <release version="1.2.2" date="2005-10-24">
            <action dev="joachims" type="add">
                Added possibility to define custom way of retrieving the XML definitions.
                File resources are still the default but it is possible to create a custom mechanism,
                e.g. InputStreams from sockets etc. Have a look at the new class Gui4jResourceProvider.

                Added support for popup menus in "matrix" component. Added attribute "popupContext" for

            <action dev="kayk" type="update">
                Changed the behaviour of "matrix" component in such a way that a programmatic change of cell
                selection (via attribute "cellSelectionPair") causes only a single call to the method defined
                for attribute "onCellSelect" of subcomponent "matrixCell". Previously, two separate method calls
                were issued, one for the row change and one for the column change.

            </action>
            <action dev="kayk" type="fix"> Fixed a bug where it could happen that the actionCommand of an 
                edit-component was not executed when the user pressed ENTER.
            </action>
            <action dev="kayk" type="fix"> Fixed a bug that caused the tree specific popup menu command 
                "expandall" (see component treePopupMenuItem) to work unreliably.</action>
